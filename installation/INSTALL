Installation
------------
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing cmdtypist and all 
it's files. Run

					./install.sh 

to install cmdtypist

RUNNING:
-------

If install.sh exited with a success message, then you have installed cmdtypist,
you can then run the command 

	cmdtypist argument1 argument2 argument3

from any directory. argument1, argument2,... are valid cmdtypist arguments, 
to know all valid arguments, run the cmdtypist help command or consult the help 
file which comes with the program.

If running cmdtypist produces a "Fatal error: some files are missing" error,
then you probably did not place all cmdtypist files in the same directory.
