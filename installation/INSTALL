INSTALLATION
------------
 Pop open a terminal and make your way to the directory where cmdtypist and all its files are chilling. Then, hit up that command line with

	./install.sh

 This will get cmdtypist installed and ready to roll.

RUNNING:
-------

Once the installation process completes successfully, you'll receive a confirmation message. At that point, you can execute the following command:

	cmdtypist argument1 argument2 argument3

You can execute the `cmdtypist` command from any location, specifying valid arguments like `argument1`, `argument2`, and so forth. To explore all acceptable arguments, either utilize the `cmdtypist help` command or refer to the program's accompanying help documentation.

In case the `cmdtypist` command triggers a "Fatal error: some files are missing" message, it likely indicates that not all essential `cmdtypist` files were placed in the same directory.
