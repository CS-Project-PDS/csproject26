General Features
----------------

*Extremely fast since it is written in c
*Has lessons for non programmers and c,c++,java/android programmers
*An accurate speed algorithm in character per minute (CPM) and an approximate
in word per minute WPM(accuracy -+0.35)
*Terminal is manipulated to print green a correct character and red a wrong
character
*Keeps a record of the number of wrong and correct characters
*Creates a text file to keep a account of the user speed in details(date,
numer of errors, speed in CPM and WPM and time elapsed) for each session.


Command Line Features
---------------------

-The user can choose to type in random mode where a random block is each 
session is chosen from selected lesson.
-And in standard mode, the user types chronologically as the lesson is in
the lesson file. 
-The user can chose to modify any lesson in the lesson file easily.
-For a user who will not love to modify the lesson file, a my_own.txt file
is available for the user to paste his text file he wants to type.

NOTE: Text file should contain only ascii 7 bits characters. For this reason,
user text may some times look absurd when contains extended ascii characters 
since program has a function to ignore such characters.
-User also can choose to receive a beep for any wrong character typed (may
not work on all terminals)
-Program has the ability to remember all past settings.
-Terminal is manipulated so a user can erase characters right to the beginning
of the session line(timing reset) For each wrong character erased, number of 
errors is decremented by one.
-User session timing starts only when he types a first character (wrong or 
correct)
-If the user erases to the beginning of the session, time is reset to zero
and starts only as described above.
-The last line of each lesson session is marked blue, so user is aware and 
can take time to review speed details befor estarting the following lesson.
