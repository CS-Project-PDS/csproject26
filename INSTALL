INSTALLATION:
============

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing cmdtypist and all 
it's files.
-In the directory, run the command

					./install.sh 
to install the program. Enter password to complete installation.

Alternatively, you can use cmdtypist without running the ./install.sh script.
You will need to navigate to the program directory each time you want to run
it. install.sh helps you run it from any directory.

RUNNING:
=======

If you successfully executed the install.sh script, then you can run cmdtypist 
using the command

	begin; cmdtypist argument1 argument2 argument3

where argument is a valid cmdtypist argument, to know all valid arguments run
the cmdtypist help command.	

Note that the begin command must be followed by a comma.
begin helps you navigate to cmdtypist directory. Alternative, you can first 
run begin alone and then run cmdtypist.

If running cmdtypist produces a "Fatal error: some files are missing error"
then you probably did not run with begin; 
cmdtypist is installed in home directory
