INSTALLATION:
============

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing cmdtypist and all 
it's files.
-In the directory, run the command

					./install.sh 
to install the program. Enter password to complete installation.

Alternatively, you can use cmdtypist without running the ./install.sh script.
You will need to navigate to the program directory each time you want to run
it. install.sh helps you run it from any directory.

RUNNING:
=======

If you successfully executed the install.sh script, then you can run cmdtypist 
using the command

	begin; cmdtypist argument1 argument2 argument3

where argument is a valid cmdtypist argument, to know all valid arguments run
the cmdtypist help command or consult the help file which comes with the 
program.

Note that the begin command must be followed by a semicon as shown above.
begin helps you navigate to cmdtypist directory. Alternative, you can first 
run begin to get into cmdtypist direcoty and then run cmdtypist.

If running cmdtypist produces a "Fatal error: some files are missing error"
then you probably did not run with begin; or some files have been deleted or 
cannot be found.
