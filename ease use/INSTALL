These instructions are to ease use for ubuntu users ONLY. If you do not run
ubuntu, then manually navigate to cmdtypist directory, compile and run cmdtypist.c
using a c compilter.

Ease of use on ubuntu
--------------------- 

The sole reason for these instructions is to make it possible to run 
cmdtypist from any directory on the command line. For this reason, it is not 
an enquiry, it is optional. 

Alternatively, you can use cmdtypist without running the ./install.sh script.
You will need to navigate to the cmdtypist program directory each time you want to run
cmdtypist. install.sh helps you run it from any directory. 

Run cmdtypist from any directory
--------------------------------

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing cmdtypist and all 
it's files.
-In the ease use directory, run the command

					./install.sh 
to a create symbolic link to cmdtypist. Enter password to complete process.

RUNNING:
-------

If you successfully executed the install.sh script, then you can run cmdtypist 
using the command

	begin; cmdtypist argument1 argument2 argument3

where argument is a valid cmdtypist argument, to know all valid arguments run
the cmdtypist help command or consult the help file which comes with the 
program.

The above instructions have been tested on ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04

Note that the begin command must be followed by a semicon as shown above.
begin helps you navigate to cmdtypist directory. Alternative, you can first 
run begin to get into cmdtypist direcoty and then run cmdtypist.

If running cmdtypist produces a "Fatal error: some files are missing error"
then you probably did not run with begin; or some files have been deleted or 
cannot be found.
